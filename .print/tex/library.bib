  isbn = {978-1-61689-329-3},
  shorttitle = {Cartographic Grounds},
  abstract = {"Mapping has been one of the most fertile areas of exploration for architecture and landscape in the past few decades. While celebrating this shift in representation from the material and physical description toward the depiction of the unseen and often immaterial, Cartographic Grounds takes a critical view toward the current use of data mapping and visualization and calls for a return to traditional cartographic techniques to reimagine the manifestation and manipulation of the ground itself. Each of the ten chapters focuses on a single cartographic technique--sounding/ spot elevation, isobath/contour, hachure/hatch, shaded relief, land classification, figure-ground, stratigraphic column, cross-section, line symbol, conventional sign-- and illustrates it through beautiful maps and plans from notable designers and cartographers throughout history, from Leonardo da Vinci to James Corner Field Operations. Mohsen Mostafavi, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, introduces the book, a veritable atlas of contemporary maps and techniques that is as beautiful as it is useful"--},

  title = {How to {{Lie}} with {{Maps}}, {{Third Edition}}},
  isbn = {978-0-226-43592-3},
  abstract = {An instant classic when first published in 1991, How to Lie with Maps revealed how the choices mapmakers make\textemdash{}consciously or unconsciously\textemdash{}mean that every map inevitably presents only one of many possible stories about the places it depicts. The principles Mark Monmonier outlined back then remain true today, despite significant technological changes in the making and use of maps. The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking. \mbox{}Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda. While retaining the same brevity, range, and humor as its predecessors, this third edition includes significant updates throughout as well as new chapters on image maps, prohibitive cartography, and online maps. It also includes an expanded section of color images and an updated list of sources for further reading.},
