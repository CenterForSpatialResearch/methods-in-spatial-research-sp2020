# Methods in Spatial Research: Mapping in Public

Columbia GSAPP, Spring 2020 Session A  
Instructor: Carsten Rodin [ccr2139@columbia.edu](mailto:ccr2139@columbia.edu)  
TA: Nadine Fattaleh [nf2337@columbia.edu](mailto:nf2337@columbia.edu)  
Location: First session in 200 Buell, thereafter 208B Butler ([studio@butler](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/spaces/butler/))  

## Course Description

Methods in Spatial Research introduces key concepts required for work with geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial research in the urban humanities. This is a "making & doing" workshop course and is designed to expand the disciplinary locations in which spatial data analysis takes place. Through hands-on exercises and weekly assignments, participants will develop basic fluency with open-source mapping software, QGIS, methods of data collection and creation, and approaches and concepts in critical spatial analysis and map design.

Methods in Spatial Research is a half-semester, 1.5 credit course offered at GSAPP by the Center for Spatial Research and is open to students from across the Columbia University. Faculty and doctoral candidates may also petition to participate on a non-credit basis. Enrollment is limited by permission of the instructor. Some students will take this course in conjunction with seminar courses offered in other departments. Faculty interested in pairing their course with Methods in to Spatial Research should contact Dare Brawley ([dare.brawley@columbia.edu](mailto:dare.brawley@columbia.edu)) prior to the start of the semester.

## Learning Objectives

Through completion of the course, participants will:

- Learn foundational GIS concepts (including how the GIS data model abstracts geographic phenomena)
- Understand GIS spatial data types and the kinds of analysis that are possible with each
- Apply GIS concepts using open-source desktop software (QGIS)
- Create new spatial datasets from field observation
- Translate archival sources into new spatial datasets
- Acquire fluency with visual design concepts central to cartographic representations
- Learn foundational online publishing concepts (including html, css, and javascript)
- Apply spatial data concepts and be able to make a public web-based map

## Requirements and Grading

- 30% engaged, thoughtful, and active in-class participation and discussion
- 15% weekly discussion questions
- 15% weekly mapping tutorials
- 40% final map, presentation and 3-page reflection

Two discussion questions on the week's reading should be uploaded to "Questions" in the Google Drive folder by 6PM Thursdays. Please save these as a plain text file in the format `uni_firstnamelastname_weekN.txt` (for example, `ccr2139_carstenrodin_week2.txt`). There are no bad questions, but [this page](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching/student-teacher-communication/designing-effective-discussion-questions) has some good tips for asking better ones.

Each tutorial will have a note in **bold** at the very end explaining what you're expected to turn in. If the deliverable is a single file, upload it to the Google Drive under Deliverables > Tutorial N (where N is the number of the week's exercise) as `uni_firstnamelastname_tutorialN`. If there are multiple files, first compile them into a .zip and then follow the same convention.

Starting in Week 3, you should be thinking about a theme or topic for a final project. The discussion for that class and the following tutorial will cover how to make your own spatial datasets, both from first-hand observation and archival research. Think about what you might want to document, expose or explore, and how the materials you produce through these two frames of reference could reflect on each other. Week 4 will explore cartographic design principles and we'll consider the various design choices you'll face in telling a story about your two datasets. Finally, in Weeks 5 and 6, we'll look at how to publish your map online and make it interactive. You'll present your work-in-progress map during our last session before submitting it for review along with a short written reflection.

## Computing Resources

The course assumes all participants have access to a personal computer, ideally a laptop for in-class tutorials. You will need to download and install both [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) prior to completing the first tutorial and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for other tutorials later in the semester. Please contact the instructor directly with any issues or questions related to hardware/software.

During the semester, students are encouraged to take advantage of the resources offered by the [Lehman Library Map Collection](https://library.columbia.edu/libraries/maps.html) and the [Empirical Reasoning Center](https://erc.barnard.edu) at Barnard.

## Course Materials & Resources

This page is both your syllabus and map to all course-related resources. The course schedule can be found below, and contains links to all tutorials. Readings and tutorial datasets can be found in the [course folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IVjKSGSpNVmGB6r6zkiWuKoeryMfxZow?usp=sharing) on Google Drive. In an attempt to keep things simple, we will not be using CourseWorks or any other online materials.

## Registration

Students from outside GSAPP are welcome to take the course, please follow the instructions provided on [this page](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/cross-registration) to register and contact both the instructor and TA with any questions/issues.

## Community and Accessibility

This is a discussion and collaborative-critique based course. All students and the instructor must be respectful of others in the classroom. If you ever feel that the classroom environment is discouraging your participation or is problematic in anyway please contact the instructor.

GSAPP is committed to full inclusion of all students. Students needing any form of accommodation due to a disability should speak with the instructor at the beginning of the semester.

## Academic Integrity

Students in all GSAPP courses are expected to uphold the highest levels of academic integrity and abide by the [Honor Code](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/honor-system) and [Plagiarism Policy](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/plagiarism-policy).
