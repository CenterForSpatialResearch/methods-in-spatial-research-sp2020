# Methods in Spatial Research: Mapping in Public

Columbia GSAPP, Spring 2020 (Session A)  
Instructor: Carsten Rodin  

## Course Description

Methods in Spatial Research introduces key concepts required for work with geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial research in the urban humanities. This is a "making & doing" workshop course and is designed to expand the disciplinary locations in which spatial data analysis takes place. Through hands-on exercises and weekly assignments, participants will develop basic fluency with open-source mapping software, QGIS, methods of data collection and creation, and approaches and concepts in critical spatial analysis and map design.

Methods in Spatial Research is a half-semester, 1.5 credit course offered at GSAPP by the Center for Spatial Research and is open to students from across the Columbia University. Faculty and doctoral candidates may also petition to participate on a non-credit basis. Enrollment is limited by permission of the instructor. Some students will take this course in conjunction with seminar courses offered in other departments. Faculty interested in pairing their course with Methods in to Spatial Research should contact Dare Brawley ([dare.brawley@columbia.edu](mailto:dare.brawley@columbia.edu)) prior to the start of the semester.

## Learning Objectives

Through completion of the course, participants will:

- Learn foundational GIS concepts (including how the GIS data model abstracts geographic phenomena)
- Understand GIS spatial data types and the kinds of analysis that are possible with each
- Apply GIS concepts using open-source desktop software (QGIS)
- Create new spatial datasets from field observation
- Translate archival sources into new spatial datasets
- Acquire fluency with visual design concepts central to cartographic representations
- Learn foundational online publishing concepts (including html, css, and javascript)
- Apply spatial data concepts and be able to make a public web-based map

## Requirements and Grading

30% engaged, thoughtful, and active in-class participation and discussion of assigned readings and mapping tutorials  
15% weekly written reading responses and map critiques  
30% weekly mapping tutorials  
25% mapping portfolio and presentation, revision of two selected mapping tutorials and two selected reading responses or map critiques into an online portfolio of work and 10-minute in-class presentation on the portfolio in progress.

Starting in week 3, you should be thinking about a theme or topic for a final project. We'll have two tutorials on making spatial datasets, during which you'll be able to choose a subject and produce two sets of data. Think about how they might interact with each other through juxtaposition or superimposition. Week 5 will focus on cartographic design principles and we'll consider the various design choices you'll face in telling a story about your two datasets. Finally, in week 6, we'll look at how to publish your map online and make it interactive. This map will be the final project.

## Community and Accessibility

This is a discussion and collaborative-critique based course. All students and the instructor must be respectful of others in the classroom. If you ever feel that the classroom environment is discouraging your participation or is problematic in anyway please contact the instructor.

GSAPP is committed to full inclusion of all students. Students needing any form of accommodation due to a disability should speak with the instructor at the beginning of the semester.

## Computing Resources

The course assumes all participants have access to a personal computer. You will need to download and install both [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) prior to completing the first tutorial. Please contact the instructor directly with any computing issues.

## Academic Integrity

Students in all GSAPP courses are expected to uphold the highest levels of academic integrity and abide by the [Honor Code](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/honor-system) and [Plagiarism Policy](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/plagiarism-policy).
