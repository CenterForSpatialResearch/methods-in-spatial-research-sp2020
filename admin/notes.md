# Curriculum Development Notes

## Admin

- [ ] Write remaining tutorials
- [ ] Create participation/attendance sheets
- [ ] Obtain copy of the referenced Honor Code and Plagarism Policy
- [ ] set up print build script to pull reading pdfs and put them in build folder 

## Syllabus (Document)

- [ ] Clarify intent around teaching both open-source desktop GIS and web maps
  - Secondary title, "Mapping in Public"?
  - Highlight this in tutorials where possible 
- Possible to work in something on internet infrastructure and how the internet itself is a spatial technology
- Terminology: spatial data vs GIS?
- Terminology: participatory sensing?
- [ ] Fix typos
- [ ] Add section on computing resources & expectations
- [ ] Proofread syllabus for clarity
- [ ] how to remove "figure" from captions, see [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/82456/how-to-remove-figure-caption-prefix-figure-in-beamer)
- [ ] finish tweaking csl file so syllabus bibliography renders correctly
