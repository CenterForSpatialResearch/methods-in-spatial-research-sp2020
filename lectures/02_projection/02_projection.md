# Wk 2: Projections, Making Data From Data

## Reading Discussion Questions

1. Alongside Corner's discussions about whether a map (or the act of mapping) can be neutral or not, I would also like to question the nature of the instrument used to map - the apparatus, software, etc - and the manner in which it limits and delimits the possibilities of mapping itself. To elaborate using a quote by Couclelis - 
"How the geographical world is understood is a function of at least two kinds of separate considerations: one has to do with geographic scale, the other with human intentionality, or purpose." - however, is this human intentionality independent of the bounds of the apparatus within which one tries to understand the geographical world? Can one intend to map a certain conception of a place (or a place-event) when the mapping device simply doesn't allow you to do so?

2. With the dual role of collecting data as a fieldworker, and mapping the collected data, how does one incorporate the debates regarding the vector vs raster into the manner in which one conducts themselves in the field? What kind of ramifications might it have on fieldwork and a larger idea of the kind of world we are conceiving?

Corner claims contemporary mapping scholars have begun to demonstrate how even the most
objective descriptions of reality are culturally situated. Does Couclesis’ view on GIS align with
this description?
Why are the notions of ‘time-space’ relevant in mapping? Are they counter to objectiveness?

Couclelis suggests that mathematical earth sciences should and when mapping natural features (landscapes, and the movement of nature), it would be best to start with raster mapping as it is challenging to define where “the actual course of the water channel” or “where the valley ends and the hills begins”. Through this class, I am interested in exploring questions such as:

how should these natural land and water masses in constant movement be represented? Possibly through a subtle gradient or a defined moment/line as commonly seen (i.e. water mass low and high tides, over a certain period of time)?

Due to the limitations of raster mapping representing surfaces, what modes of representation are necessary to map three dimensional natural landscapes (i.e. spreading toxicity through soil in all directions)? Would this be creating separate/ overlayed maps at each certain levels?

Has this limitation in mapping cause neglect in public interest or major advancements in research of issues deeper than what is at the surface?

Mapping is, according to Corner (1999), a "collective enabling entrerprise" in contrast with "the reduction of planning", and his examples offer a nuber of mapping concepts and techniques that are more attuned to this proposal. Nevertheless the agents of his examples are still experts or privileged in a form or other (artists, Situationist activists, urbanists, etc.) and the collective aspect remained a little removed from the practice/technique. How can current mapping (and in our case, QGIS) incorporate a collective mapping enterprise that efectively enables and gives agency to a community, not only in the capacity of data-collectors, but also with power to design and represent new realities in a ground-up, community based mapping project? 


As a partiipant of the Subalter Urbanism seminar, one of our intial points of discussion was centered around the concepts of "informality" and how it shapes the urban exerience of the Global South. The opposition between "object" and "field", presented by Couclelis (1992), suggested to me the challenges of mapping "informality" (mobile street vendors, temporary homes, etc.) having the vector/object frame. How can we use QGIS to represent this form of urban experience?

1. "Maps must by necessity be abstract if they are to sustain meaning and utility" (222). "Although drawn from measured observations in the world, mappings are neither depictions nor representations but mental constructs, ideas that enable and effect change" (250). These quotes stuck out to me because of the theoretical potential they hold for the way ideas are represented. If the map is the tool that engenders a design, how can a map be a tool that engenders an idea? Can (and how can) one map the immaterial/theoretical, once acknowledging the tension between reality and representation? (I guess this is a question that concerns more of what a map means than what it does)

2. I was really compelled by thinking about technical details in philosophical terms, especially as a History major. In what ways do vector and raster data affect the way we understand historical maps? How do we understand (categorize) the past?

1. Can a map ever be “true and neutral” (why/why not)? Given Carver’s description of cartography as a “creative activity” and its product as a representation of reality, how is map-making similar to/different from creating art?

2. What questions should we ask in order to ensure that we are making a “map not a tracing” and using map-making as a radical cultural intervention? How can/should we interrogate GIS and other software generally deemed legitimate, unbiased analytical tools to ensure we are not leaving people/experiences out of our maps?

Corner does an excellent job examining the subjectivity of maps, what they are able to show us,
who or what groups are prioritized, examining how radically different spatial and socio-political
structures can be represented depending on who is behind the map. Keeping that in mind, in what
ways can we strive toward a map-making that can be a subversion of hegemonic modes of map-
making?

Considering that the subaltern is often considered a “limit of recognition” or a “vanishing point”,
how should this inform the mapping of spaces?


If alternative mapping practices (rhizomes, drifting, etc) express abstract, intersubjective relationships within the world based on individual practices of exploration, how can they be used to empower and liberate groups of people who may not necessarily be granted access to such forms of perspective-making? For instance, slum dwellers may be forced to see their political life in terms of government or civic maps--even while their lived experiences may be different--making questions of such experimental mapping perhaps a little trite.

The question of "features" seems tied with the issues of ontology and narrative. How does one move beyond a feature or narrative oriented mapping to equally valorize both vector and raster data? 

If, as Corner argues, maps are meant to be abstract if they are to sustain any
meaning, should we be using raster GIS rather than vectors for our maps to have utility
(given Couclelis view that vectors rigid shapes that reflect control and domination over
geographical space?)
• - Given Corner’s discussion on the intersubjectivity of maps, and his assertion
that a map always precedes territory, how can we use mapping as tools for redefining
spatial politics?

Baudrillard’s discussion of the “real” and the “hyper-real” blurs the difference between
these two as he argues that the hyper-real shapes, informs, and actively co-creates our
perceptions and understandings of the real. This is as true for TV and radio programming
about a place, for example, as it is of a map. Following Baudrillard’s argument, are the
stakes of mapping such that “the map” actively co-creates or actualizes its geographies or
ideas? If so, does this occur for maps that are ideas of alternatives modes of being or
possible futures?

Couclelis argues that intuitive spatial “human cognition” is likely far ahead of the
representations and approximations of geographical systems (71), and likely will be for
some time. The piece was written in 1992; does the same hold today? Are geographical
systems today able to be more fluid, adaptive, or “experimental,” and if so what are the
results?

  - couclelis
    - discuss the field/object metaphor. what kinds of things could you map with each? can anyone think of anything that blurs this boundary or would be mappable in both schemes? how would this change the way we read and interpret the map?
  - corner
    - talk about the table metaphor
    - link to the field/object conversation
    - talk about how this can be thought of in relation to projections. we need a common environment for our table. 
    - talk about joins, ability to link or compare two datasets with one another. this allows quantitative comparisons
    - what are some ways to draw connections between two datasets or layers qualititatively?

## Mini Lecture: A Survey of Surveys

- the history of maps is closely linked with the history of surveying
  - world maps vs city maps
- three (and a half) brief episodes:
  - focused on: translation (through scale) from real-world measurement to paper space

- map of rome (who?) measured in polar coordinates 
  - Alberti "Descriptio Urbis Romae"
  - Bufalini, 100 years later
    - used a *bussola* to measure the map probably from a single point as well
- Cassini - mapping france
  - we start with the oldest cassini
  - mapping at the time has the problem of measuring longitude
  - need accurate acounting of time in two places simultaneously
  - was into jupiter
  - knows about galileo's idea to use jupiter as a clock
  - france kind of tricks him into staying here

- meades ranch
  - from 1913 to 1989, was the reference location for all surveys in the continent
- when we get to satellite mapping and the digital era is when we start to have the need for systematic translation between multiple reference systems.
- birth of the "geographic coordinate system" now we mostly use WGS84, EPSG (?) to store data as lat long and altitude as given by gps transponders

## Digest & Discuss Some Terms

- coordinate systems
  - geographic
  - "projected" (mapped)
- projections
  - define a process for converting information in one coordinate system into another. gives us the ability to translate
  - goal: creation of a universal environment for viewing and processing spatial data
- datum
- angular units (vs linear)
- latitude and longitude

- what happens if you draw unprojected data?
  - McHarg center atlas for the green new deal got major criticism on map nerd twitter for doing this. it really isn't a good look

- what are your choices?
  - mostly won't matter very much for "architecture urbanism and the humanities" (implicit audience of the class)
  - differences are most aparent at global scale

- EPSG codes - public registry of projections. Stands for European Petroleum Survey Group. These codes define 'recipes' of:
  - spatial reference system
  - earth ellipsoid
  - coordinate transformation
  - units of measurement
  - common ones are epsg:4326 which defines raw lat/long coordinates for GPS, 3857 "Web Mercator" for tile servers, QGIS has these built in, and this is what you see in the status bar for your projection

- From Corner, we can wonder about some of the specifics of how we might draw connections between different peices of data once they're on our 'field'

- table join

- thanks to the creation of a universal environment for viewing and processing spatial data, we can now also do a **spatial join**

- talk about data types: point, line, polygon
  - point to polygon
  - polygon to polygon (concerns)
