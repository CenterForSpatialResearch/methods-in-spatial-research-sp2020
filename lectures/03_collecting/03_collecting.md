title: "Week 3: Collecting"
---

- Questions on the tutorial
  - Extended deadline - Sunday evening
  - Recap/show how to do the spatial join again, make sure to show attributes, how field titles get created, concept of count versus other aggregation functions
  - Other questions?
- Discuss reading
  - remember, this is now setup or background for the next tutorial (on collecting data from observation and archives)
  - Try small-group discussion first?
  - Morris, Voyce "Embodied Mapping, Locative Mapping, and New Media Poetics"
    - Morris, Dee, and Stephen Voyce. "Embodied Mapping, Locative Mapping, and New Media Poetics." Jacket2, March 20, 2015. ([link](https://jacket2.org/commentary/embodied-mapping-locative-mapping-and-new-media-poetics))
    - What is a locative map?
    - What is an embodied map?
    - What does it mean that "mapping might be thought to have lost its body"?
      - Not disturbed by, affected by, or reflective of actual life...
      - Can we relate this to how we've lost our own bodies or risk doing so (student comment re: *we are becoming our tools - how can we make these tools speak our language rather than the other way around*)
    - Birds-eye (de Certeau)
    - Bottom-up (claim: surreal, situationist, "locative new media cartography" are this)
    - How do we think GPS maps compare weith the situationists? Is the time signature enough to make it not top-down?
    - The (which kind) map is not completed
    - What does it mean to be "thick/deep"
      - Student response: *"‘bottom-up’ or “thick” mapping can allow the people being mapped new forms of agency and control over telling their own stories"*
    - "the difference between top-down and bottom-up mapping is not technologically determined" what do we make of this claim?
      - Student: *"Lateral distribution of work and power" - do they facilitate a "data-democracy"? Drawbacks? Position of the expert (scientist, researcher)*
      - Student: *how can (and, is) bottom-up mapping be accessible to people without equitable access to the technology, data, time, etc.?*
    - what do we think about the possibility of superimposition to produce a genuine sense of embodiment or location?
      - Student: *"Thinking from the example of Levine's media poem, how do we tackle the lines between constructing a spectacle vs representing an event..."*
  - Pavlovskaya "Non-Quantitative GIS"
    - Pavlovskaya, Marianna. "Non-Quantitative GIS." In Qualitative GIS: A Mixed Methods Approach, 13–38. London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.
    - Student: *"two different software packages may produce slightly different map results in terms of visibility, etc, since each is made with separate sets of algorithms."*
    - Student: "GIS is oozing with power" - *how does columbia teach GIS? (Ask group what other classes are available). How does the university employ GIS in other activities, how does it advance political or economic agendas?*
    - Student: *"author describes quant. analysis ... but claims they are not quantitative because techniquest do not require knowledge of advanced math. from GIS users". is this a fair understanding of non-quantitative?*

- lecture discussion
  - humanities gis is really generation-heavy (vs using readymade datasets)
  - how to think of data itself and how its stored is super important

  - "everything that happens happens today" brian house
    - "Over a period of one year, I tracked the GPS location of 1000 anonymous volunteers in NYC, at all times, via a custom app they installed on their phones. I used these data to train an artificial intelligence algorithm... The algorithm was subsequently able to generate a new path around NYC that synthesized the daily behaviors of all of the volunteers. I then followed the AI through the city for one week without stopping, using another custom app to get directions in real-time on my phone. I took photographs (with my phone) of the daily life I encountered and wrote in a journal. The intelligence of AI is not spontaneous, but socialized. It is uncanny not because it acts as if it were human, but because it is humans, plural. They may be subsumed into the whole, but this whole is a trace of its parts. By following it, will I find them?"
    - this could be a good way to introduce the itinerary vs map concept

  - the map and the itinerary (walking in the city)
  - the situationists (probably have seen?)


  - thread of observational mapping running through japanese architecture
    - Kon Wajiro (c 1930s)
    - Architectural Detective Agency (1970s)
      - "The Architectural Detective Agency (1974). The official map of Tokyo’s Chiyoda ward carried by Terunobu Fujimori and Takeyoshi Hori on their daily surveys. Roads they walked are marked in yellow while buildings they investigated are marked in red. Courtesy of Terunobu Fujimori & Takeyoshi Hori."
    - Atelier Bow Wow (1990s-present)
    - Architectual Ethnography - Japanese Pavilion at 2018 venice pavilion
  - open streetmap
    - worldwide open data collection initiative
    - enabled by GPS - people collect "GPS Traces"
  - Walking Papers
    - was a (now defunct) web-based service that allowed a user to print out open streetmap data, draw on it to add new features, and read it back in to an interface to digitize the features.
    - "...is **a way to “round trip” map data through paper**, to make it easier to perform the kinds of eyes-on-the-street edits that OSM needs now the most"

  - what to say about archives?
    - think back to corner, we have our (frame?) we want extracts so we can produce plottings
    - warping and manipulating extracts to fit the frame
    - library science is your friend
    - mapping the transcript
  - other ideas?

- introduce tutorial
  - will be ready saturday afternoon
